# OpenCode catalog refresh — 2026-08-21

Primary sources:

- Go documentation and endpoint table: https://opencode.ai/docs/go/
- Go live catalog: https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1/models
- Zen documentation, endpoint table, free pricing, and deprecations: https://opencode.ai/docs/zen
- Zen live catalog: https://opencode.ai/zen/v1/models

The anonymous `opencode-free` provider remains catalog-only. Its live Zen
catalog currently exposes these nine IDs through the router's documented
`big-pickle` or `-free` filter:

`big-pickle`, `deepseek-v4-flash-free`, `hy3-free`,
`laguna-s-2.1-free`, `mimo-v2.5-free`,
`muse-spark-1.2-contributor-free`, `nemotron-3-ultra-free`,
`nemotron-3.5-lightning-free`, and `x-preview-f-free` (documented by OpenCode
as **Ox Alpha Free**).

Ox Alpha is a stealth model: OpenCode publishes its callable id and display
name but not its maker. The control center therefore uses the OpenCode provider
mark instead of guessing a model-company logo from community speculation.

Zen also remains catalog-only because it is pay-as-you-go and its list changes
without notice. Both catalogs are fetched by `discover-models` / `curate-models`
from their official `/models` endpoints; the repository does not turn their
live contents into an implicit provider selection.

The Go documentation names 20 current subscription models. The checked-in
registry contains those exact upstream IDs and uses the endpoint family the
official table specifies (`chat/completions`, `messages`, or `responses`). The
2026-08-21 addition is `muse-spark-1.2-contributor` on Responses.

The live Go `/models` response also contained seven IDs not in the
documentation's current-model list. They are intentionally not advertised as
checked-in Go models:

| Live-only ID | Reason not shipped |
| --- | --- |
| `minimax-m2.5` | The Zen documentation marks it deprecated on 2026-08-05. |
| `kimi-k2.5` | The Zen documentation marks it deprecated on 2026-08-05. |
| `glm-5` | The Zen documentation marks it deprecated on 2026-05-14. |
| `qwen3.5-plus` | Not in the Go documentation's current-model or Go endpoint table. |
| `mimo-v2-pro` | Not in the Go documentation's current-model or Go endpoint table. |
| `mimo-v2-omni` | Not in the Go documentation's current-model or Go endpoint table. |
| `hy3-preview` | Not in the Go documentation's current-model or Go endpoint table. |

A future refresh should update this table if the official current-model list
adopts one of those IDs.

OpenCode's statement that its models work well as coding agents is useful
provider evidence for routing, but it is not the native Codex collaboration
proof required for `multiAgentVersion: "v2"`. Every OpenCode model therefore
stays conservative v1 unless that separate marker-return, encrypted relay, and
same-thread follow-up proof is completed.
