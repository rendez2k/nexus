# macOS tray app

Model Router Tray is a native macOS Dynamic-Island-style overlay plus menu-bar
control panel for the local Nexus router. The top-center island follows the
provider handling the latest request, reveals live usage on hover, expands on
click, and surfaces concurrent model requests when more than one agent is
active. The tray shows Codex service state, an all-provider usage overview,
active-provider detail, and provider setup shared with the existing
command-line control plane.

The tray focuses on Codex and does not disable, uninstall, or change the
existing router configuration.

## Start at login

The first time the tray runs from its app bundle, it registers itself as a
macOS login item so it reopens automatically after a reboot — no more manual
`./bin/model-router-tray` after every sign-in. macOS shows its standard
"added a login item" notice, and the Settings tab gains a **Start at login**
toggle backed by `SMAppService`, so the item is also visible and removable
under System Settings › General › Login Items. The automatic registration
happens only once: if you turn the item off in either place, the tray never
re-adds it. The login item points at the built bundle (`dist/Model
Router.app` by default), so rerun `./bin/model-router-tray` after an update
to rebuild the binary the login item launches. If the bundle moves after that
first launch (for example from a checkout on a removable volume to the stable
install), the next launch replaces the old login-item path with the current
bundle instead of leaving a broken item behind. Running the bare executable
via `swift run` provides no bundle identity, so the toggle is hidden there.
The router's background service is a separate launchd agent and keeps running
regardless of this setting.

The Settings tab's **Models** section has two accordions. **Subagent models**
exposes every enabled model, or only selected models, as Codex v2 subagent
overrides; **Model picker** hides or shows individual models without changing
their provider connection. Restart Codex after changing either group so its
model picker reloads the merged catalog.

## Show tray only while Codex runs

The Settings tab's **Show tray** control chooses when the tray surfaces are
visible. **Always** (the default) keeps the menu bar icon present like any
menu bar app. **With Codex** ties every surface — menu bar icon, Dynamic
Island, and desktop panel — to the Codex and ChatGPT desktop apps
(`com.openai.codex`, `com.openai.chat`): the tray appears when either app
launches and disappears when the last one quits. The tray process itself
stays resident as a lightweight watcher; quitting on app exit would leave
nothing around to notice the next launch. Combined with **Start at login**,
this makes the tray fully automatic: it waits invisibly after a reboot and
shows up exactly while Codex is open. While hidden, reopen Codex (or run
`defaults write io.github.codex-router.tray ModelRouterTray.presenceMode
always` and relaunch) to reach the toggle again. The router's background
service is unaffected by visibility.

## Provider usage

The tray's **All usage** grid shows only connected accounts: ChatGPT when native
account usage is available, and external providers with a configured OAuth
session or API key. Enabling a provider or retaining historical local traffic
does not create a card without credentials. Each quota window gets its own card
with a short limit label and a single reset line. Official account balance is
shown when available; otherwise a connected account falls back to clearly
labeled seven-day traffic measured by this router. Cards can be clicked to
inspect that provider.
ChatGPT is the initial detail view only when native ChatGPT usage is available;
otherwise the tray starts with an existing external provider. The detailed
view and the Island automatically return to the provider handling the next
Codex request. Hover the Island for a quick view or click it for expanded
account usage. During activity, the compact Island shows the provider's
published mark and the Codex session title instead of repeating the provider
name. Additional
concurrent requests appear as a muted, unframed `+N`; hover lists every live
routed session with its status and elapsed time while retaining the seven-day
usage graph and today's usage metrics. When the selected provider reports a
weekly quota, its percentage used stays pinned to the compact Island's trailing
edge during both idle and active sessions.

- ChatGPT shows the subscription limit and daily buckets reported by the
  installed Codex app-server; the tray never reads or copies the ChatGPT
  credential file.
- External OAuth and API providers have separate account meters and local
  traffic graphs. The Island shows today's token total and a fixed seven-day
  daily line graph beside the provider-reported quota percentage used. Kimi
  Code OAuth reads weekly and five-hour quota from Kimi's
  usage API with the existing CLI session. Grok OAuth reads weekly or monthly
  credit usage from the official Grok CLI chat-proxy billing endpoint with the
  existing `~/.grok/auth.json` session. Near expiry, or after one rejected
  request, the router asks the installed official Grok CLI to refresh its own
  OAuth session and retries once. DeepSeek and Kimi Platform API show balance
  from their official API-key endpoints. Anthropic and xAI API keys use the
  clearly labeled local-router traffic fallback because those account balances
  are not exposed here. The app does not silently import browser cookies.
- Local graphs cover only traffic sent through this router on this Mac and are
  labeled that way. A local graph is never presented as provider-wide billing
  or remaining subscription quota.
- Daily token charts in the tray can show 7, 30, or 90 days. Seven-day charts
  label every weekday; longer ranges use spaced date ticks while retaining one
  point per day. The Island uses a fixed seven-day line graph so hover remains
  quick and the longer ranges stay in the tray. Hover any mark for its date and
  exact token count. When the provider reports a quota reset, its local reset
  date and time appear beside the chart title. Usage refreshes every 30 seconds,
  and the detailed view switches when a new request uses a different provider.
  A provider selected manually remains focused for the rest of the current
  request so its usage can be inspected without activity polling overriding the
  selection; automatic following resumes with the next request.
- The Island status mark uses Thinking Orbs **Shaping** while idle,
  **Thinking** while generating, and **Solving** for errors. Starting retains
  its amber status dot, and the Error label remains explicit. The
  daily line draws in once when opened or refreshed. Reduce Motion disables
  decorative movement. The Island is shown by default and can be toggled from
  the tray.
- When multiple Codex model requests run at the same time, the Island shows the
  first provider mark and session title plus `+N` for the remaining requests.
  Hover and expand list each live request with its provider mark, session
  title, Thinking status, and elapsed time. Long titles pan to the end and
  bounce back; Reduce Motion leaves them clipped. Session titles are resolved
  from Codex's local session index and are not copied into usage history. The
  focused usage view still follows the newest active request.
- Local routed-model events record timestamp, model, provider, HTTP status,
  duration, and the input/output/total token counts reported by the provider.
  Prompts, responses, and API keys are never stored. Provider metering begins
  after installing this version; older events are not guessed or reassigned.

The overlay interaction is inspired by
[CodexIsland](https://github.com/ericjypark/codex-island): compact information
at rest, richer usage detail on hover, and a full panel on click. On a notched
Mac it sits flush with the screen edge; on other displays it behaves as a
top-center floating island. The menu-bar item remains available as a fallback
and configuration surface.

The provider-meter hierarchy follows the privacy-first pattern demonstrated by
[CodexBar](https://github.com/steipete/CodexBar): show quota, balance, or spend
only when that provider exposes an appropriate source, and keep local traffic
as a distinct fallback.

The tray uses the native macOS popover material and follows the current system
appearance. It intentionally uses standard system typography, controls, and
separators rather than applying a second opaque dashboard skin inside the
popover.

Run it from a stable checkout on macOS:

```sh
./bin/model-router-tray
```

The app builds a local `dist/Model Router.app` bundle and opens it. The bundle
records the checkout path used at build time, so rebuild it after moving the
repository.

`bin/model-router-tray` replaces an already-running tray with the rebuilt
bundle before opening it, and `codex update` rebuilds and relaunches an
installed tray from the updated checkout whether it lives in the checkout's
`dist` directory, `~/Applications`, or the registered login-item bundle, so
the companion stays current without a manual rerun.

Provider changes apply automatically. Enabling, disabling, signing in, or
adding an API key updates Codex immediately; the provider row shows progress
while the router configuration and service are refreshed. If applying fails,
the tray restores the previous provider selection and shows the error.

The **Update & Verify** maintenance button applies the checked-out `main`
revision to the per-user Codex installation, then runs the Codex doctor. It
shows progress while both commands run and reports whether routed model agents
and the rest of the installation passed verification. Restart Codex afterward
to load updated models and custom agents. The command targets the checkout
recorded as the installation owner, so a tray bundle left over from an older
checkout cannot refresh the wrong router instead of the installed one.

The **Use without OpenAI login** switch changes new Codex sessions to the
managed custom router provider. At least one external provider must be connected
and enabled. After applying the change, the tray gracefully quits and reopens
the registered Codex desktop app so the new mode takes effect. It never
force-quits Codex; if the app does not quit or reopen, the mode remains changed
and the tray asks you to restart Codex manually. Turning the switch off restores
the previous root model-provider setting; neither direction reads, changes, or
deletes ChatGPT credentials. The mode keeps the current external model when
possible, otherwise selects the first model from a connected, enabled provider,
and restores the previous model when switched off.

## Adding providers and models

The Providers section is also the onboarding surface for every model source in
the registry. OAuth providers show **Install** when their official CLI is
missing and **Sign In** when the CLI has no usable session. API providers show
**Add Key** and accept the key in a native secure field.

- Kimi OAuth installs the official `@moonshot-ai/kimi-code` CLI.
- Grok OAuth installs the official `@xai-official/grok` CLI.
- API keys are sent to the control process over standard input, written to the
  router's protected credential file, and never placed in process arguments or
  command output.
- Completing sign-in or adding a key automatically enables that provider and
  exposes its models to new Codex tasks.
