# Installation, migration, and upgrades

This page covers the Codex target:

```sh
./bin/model-router codex doctor
```

## Supported hosts

| Host | Codex surface |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | Codex App or CLI |
| Windows | Codex App or CLI |
| Linux | Codex CLI |

Required software:

- Node.js 22.19+ (Node.js 24 LTS recommended)
- `uv`, or Python 3.10+ with `venv`
- Git for managed one-command installation and rollback
- At least one Kimi OAuth, Kimi API, or DeepSeek API credential

The installer does not silently install a system package manager or runtime.
When a prerequisite is missing, install it from its official source and rerun
the same command.

## Ask Codex to install it

```text
Install Nexus from:
https://github.com/duolahypercho/codex-router

Follow AGENTS.md. Preserve all of my existing Codex settings and ChatGPT login.
Use only the provider authentication I choose, safely migrate recognized older
versions with a rollback snapshot, run the doctor, and do not quit Codex for me.
Never ask me to paste a token or API key into chat.
```

Codex should use a stable checkout, not a temporary directory. The service
definition stores the checkout's absolute path.

## Guided terminal install

macOS or Linux:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/duolahypercho/codex-router/main/install.sh | sh -s -- --guided
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$installer = Join-Path $env:TEMP "codex-router-install.ps1"
Invoke-WebRequest https://raw.githubusercontent.com/duolahypercho/codex-router/main/install.ps1 -OutFile $installer
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File $installer -Guided
```

Clone-and-review installation is also supported:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/duolahypercho/codex-router.git
cd codex-router
./install.sh --guided
```

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/duolahypercho/codex-router.git
Set-Location codex-router
./install.ps1 -Guided
```

On macOS and Linux, guided setup also offers to build and launch the desktop
companion (the macOS menu bar app or the Windows/Linux tray). `--with-tray`
installs it without asking, `--no-tray` never offers it, and automatic mode
skips it. On macOS the app bundle is placed in `~/Applications` and needs the
Swift toolchain; a missing toolchain skips the step with guidance instead of
failing setup. Windows still builds the tray manually with
`scripts/build-desktop-tray.ps1`.
Guided setup walks through numbered steps: a provider list you toggle by
number (`a` selects all, `n` clears, Enter continues) with a live
ready/needs-key/needs-sign-in status per provider, credential onboarding for
anything you selected that is not connected yet, and a review summary before
any change is made.

## Authentication choices

Kimi Code OAuth reuses the official CLI session. Guided setup offers to run the
login command when the CLI exists:

```sh
kimi login
```

API-key providers use hidden prompts:

```sh
./bin/provider-key kimi-api set
./bin/provider-key deepseek set
./bin/provider-key grok-api set
./bin/provider-key anthropic-api set
./bin/provider-key ollama-cloud set
./bin/provider-key qwen-plan set
./bin/provider-key zai-coding set
./bin/provider-key github-copilot set
```

Replace a stored key by running `set` again. Delete one with `remove`, which
also hides the provider from the model picker:

```sh
./bin/provider-key deepseek remove
```

The desktop app and macOS tray expose the same two actions per API provider:
**Replace key** and **Remove**. Removal only deletes the key files the router
manages — a key that also lives in the macOS Keychain or in an environment
variable is reported as still active so you can clear it at the source.

Grok OAuth uses the official Grok CLI session:

```sh
npm install -g @xai-official/grok
grok login --oauth
./bin/model-router codex providers enable grok-oauth
```

The OAuth token remains in `~/.grok/auth.json` and is sent only to xAI's Grok
CLI inference proxy. The separate `grok-api` provider continues to use a
separately billed xAI API key.

Windows:

```powershell
./codex-router.ps1 provider-key kimi-api set
./codex-router.ps1 provider-key deepseek set
./codex-router.ps1 provider-key grok-api set
./codex-router.ps1 provider-key anthropic-api set
./codex-router.ps1 provider-key github-copilot set
```

Kimi OAuth, Kimi Platform, DeepSeek, xAI, Anthropic, and GitHub Copilot are separate account and billing
systems. Never put a credential in chat, a command argument, shell history,
the provider registry, or a tracked file.

GitHub Copilot requires a fine-grained PAT with the **Copilot Requests**
permission. After storing it, run `./bin/curate-models github-copilot`; the
provider publishes no fixed model list because model and protocol availability
depends on the account's plan and organization policy. The router does not read
the official Copilot CLI credential store.

Noninteractive setup can reuse already configured credentials:

```sh
./install.sh --auto --providers configured --migrate-known
```

Or choose an exact set:

```sh
./install.sh --auto --providers kimi-oauth
./install.sh --kimi-api-key --auto
./install.sh --deepseek-api-key --auto
./install.sh --anthropic-api-key --auto
./install.sh --auto --providers kimi-oauth,kimi-api,deepseek
```

`--smoke-test` makes one small live request per provider and may use paid quota;
it is never enabled by default.

An API key found only in the installer's shell environment is valid for
foreground commands but is not copied into launchd, systemd, or Task Scheduler.
Use `provider-key ... set` so the per-user background service has persistent,
protected access.

## Installer transaction

Setup performs these operations in order:

1. Validates provider selection and credential presence.
2. Detects other model-catalog owners and earlier Nexus variants.
3. With approval, snapshots and stops only recognized older variants.
4. Installs locked Node dependencies and pinned LiteLLM in `.venv`.
5. Generates separate random Codex caller and internal-service keys.
6. Captures the native Codex model catalog and adds only selected provider models.
7. Generates gateway routes from the split registry tree under `config/`.
8. Adds the marked capability-bearing base URL and catalog block. When the user
   has not set an agent concurrency limit, it also configures six spawned-agent
   slots so native Kimi/Grok/GPT collaboration does not remain on Codex's small
   v2 default. Existing `[agents]` limits are preserved.
9. Protects the Codex config and its backup for the current user.
10. Installs the platform's per-user background service.
11. Waits for every local layer to report its expected service identity.
12. Records the installed commit and provider selection.
13. Runs the doctor.

If config or service installation fails, the new service and marked config block
are removed. If a legacy migration was part of the transaction, its exact config
and service definition are restored as well.

The installer does not kill an unknown process on ports 4100–4103 and does not
replace an unmarked user-owned `openai_base_url`, `model_catalog_json`, or agent
concurrency value. Disabling the router removes only its marked concurrency
default; a user-owned value remains intact.

## Recognized older installations

Read-only detection:

```sh
./bin/migrate detect
```

The migration engine recognizes:

- `io.github.kimi-codex-router` with `~/.codex/kimi-router`
- `com.ziwenxu.kimi-codex-proxy` with `~/.codex/kimi-proxy`
- complete or malformed start-only Kimi managed config markers

Approved migration stops only those services, retains their state directories,
moves their service definitions into `$CODEX_HOME/codex-router/migrations`, and
stores the original config with protected permissions. Restore it with:

```sh
./bin/migrate rollback
```

An unknown catalog owner requires a manual decision; automatic setup stops
without changing it.

If `model_catalog_json` points to a user-owned native Codex catalog rather than
another router, you can explicitly keep it as Nexus's merge base:

```sh
./install.sh --auto --providers configured --adopt-native-catalog
```

```powershell
./install.ps1 -Auto -Providers configured -AdoptNativeCatalog
```

Adoption is accepted only when the path is absolute, the JSON contains at
least one native model, none of its slugs are already routed by Nexus,
and no custom `openai_base_url` is configured. The file stays user-owned and
is read in place on every catalog rebuild, so moving, deleting, or making it
invalid stops the rebuild with an explicit error. Disabling Nexus
restores that exact catalog path. A failed install clears a pending adoption
and leaves the original Codex config intact.

## Restart and verify

`model_catalog_json` is loaded at Codex startup. Fully quit the app, reopen it,
and create a new task. On macOS use Command-Q; on Windows use the app's Quit
command or end it from the tray if present.

```sh
./bin/doctor
./bin/providers
codex debug models
```

The doctor reports exact remediation beneath each failed layer. Safe managed
state can be rebuilt with:

```sh
./bin/doctor --fix
```

Live quota-consuming verification is separate:

```sh
./bin/smoke-test
./bin/test-model 'kimi-oauth/k3' --live --yes
```

## Update and rollback

```sh
./bin/update check
./bin/update
./bin/rollback
```

Windows:

```powershell
./codex-router.ps1 update check
./codex-router.ps1 update
./codex-router.ps1 rollback
```

The updater requires the recognized GitHub origin and a checkout with no edits
to tracked files. It fetches `origin/main`, retains the current revision under
`refs/codex-router/rollback`, fast-forwards, and reinstalls. A failed install
automatically checks out and reinstalls the previous revision. `update check`
only compares the revisions and changes nothing.

Untracked files never block an update; only edits to tracked files do, and the
refusal names them. Keep them with `git -C <checkout> stash`, or discard them by
re-running the same command with `--force` (`./bin/update --force`,
`./bin/rollback --force`, `./codex-router.ps1 rollback --force`). The bootstrap
installers take the same escape: `--force` for the `curl | sh` script and
`-Force` for the `irm | iex` one. Every force path discards tracked edits only;
none of them delete untracked files.

Setup distinguishes a broken checkout from unfinished configuration. When it
exits 2 — a declined prompt, a missing credential, an invalid `--providers`
value — the update is kept, because none of those say anything about the code
that was just fetched, and discarding it means the next attempt repeats the
same failure with the same code. Rolling back there is what made a setup-path
bug impossible to fix by updating: the fix was fetched and then thrown away.
Any other non-zero exit still restores the previous revision. Re-run setup to
continue, or `./bin/rollback` (`./codex-router.ps1 rollback` on Windows) to
return to the retained revision deliberately.

The reinstall skips dependency work whose inputs are unchanged, so an update
that carries no `package-lock.json` or LiteLLM pin change costs a service
restart rather than a full `npm ci` and PyPI resolution. `./bin/doctor --fix`
rebuilds them regardless, as does `./bin/install --force-deps`
(`./install.ps1 -CheckoutInstall -ForceDeps` on Windows).

When upgrading from a release without caller capabilities, the installer
generates one, replaces only the marked managed URL, tightens config permissions,
and restarts the per-user router service. Fully quit and reopen Codex afterward
so it reloads the new URL.

`./bin/rollback` switches to the cached previous revision and reinstalls it. A
later `./bin/update` returns the managed checkout to `main` before updating.

For a source archive without `.git`, download and install a newer tagged archive
instead. Release pages provide SHA-256 checksums and provenance attestations.

## Disable and uninstall

```sh
./bin/disable
./bin/enable
./bin/uninstall
```

Windows:

```powershell
./codex-router.ps1 disable
./codex-router.ps1 enable
./codex-router.ps1 uninstall
```

Uninstall removes the marked integration config and current background service.
It intentionally retains the checkout, native catalog cache, logs, backups,
migration snapshots, internal key, and provider credentials. This prevents a
routine uninstall from silently destroying authentication or recovery data.
